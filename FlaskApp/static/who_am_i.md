Hi my name is Josh, I am a PhD student at the University of Southampton. In a previous life I was a secondary school mathematics teacher but gave it up since I was fed up of my students having all the fun of learning new things! This is my personal blog in which I will write about random things that interest me, this will mostly consist of me making pretty pictures from interesting data. I may discuss my research but probably not....It's about x-rays if your at all interested.
